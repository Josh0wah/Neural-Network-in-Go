This is a fully functional, single-hidden-layer neural network, trained on the very famous Iris Flower Data Set to identify 3 different species of Iris flowers based on their size and shape.
I've built this neural network from scratch in Go with the help of a guide from /dwhitena.

The accuracy of results may vary due to the initial randomness of the weights and biases in this neural network, but as demonstrated above, results are generally very good, ranging 94-100% in my testing.
